# high-low-game
A small beginner-level game that gets the player to guess a number.
This game uses the Windows console in order to run.
At the moment, you will have to use your own C++ IDE in order to run the game.

The player (you) will have 7 guesses in order to determine what number the program has randomly picked from 1 to 100 inclusive.
Place your guess into the console as a integer.
If you did not get the correct number, the program will let you know if the number is either "Too high" or "Too low".

Too high means your guess is greater than the actual number.
Too low means your guess is less than the actual number.

You lose the game if you fail to guess the number correctly within 7 guesses.
You win if you do.

Have fun! This is my first mini project making a game using C++.
